# youtube-watchmarker
Youtube keeps track of your watch history and automatically marks videos that you have already watched. They however only mark recently seen videos, which is kind of disappointing. This addon fixes this issue and keeps track of your entire watch history, such that not only the recently seen videos are being marked.

## questions
<b>How can the persistence of the database be ensured?</b> There is an export and import feature, which makes it easy to create a backup of the history. This backup can  easily be archived such that you can ensure that you never lose your history.

<b>How can I make sure that the database is complete?</b> The automatic synchronization only considers the recent activity. You are thus encouraged to manually initiate a complete synchronization in the settings, which incorporates as much of your history as possible.

I would like to express my gratitude to [XP1](https://github.com/XP1) who has been a significant contributor to this project throughout the years. Not only does he support other users with their issues and opens up pull reuqest to improve this extension, he also comes up with [creative solutions](https://github.com/sniklaus/youtube-watchmarker/pull/126) such as adding a mutation observer to certain objects to detect changes in the Youtube layout.
